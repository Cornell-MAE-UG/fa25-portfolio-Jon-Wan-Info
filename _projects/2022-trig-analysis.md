RIGID BAR ANALYSIS:

Situation:
- 150 x 50 cm space
- Three pin supports (2 fixed to the ground)
- One linear actuator
GOALS:
- Lift the largest possible load to the highest possible height

OUTCOME:
- One degree of freedom four bar lift
- IMA55 Linear actuator
- Max Load: 23.98 KN
- Max Height: 450mm

Finding Beam Dimensions:

- Due to loading the beam is a two force member
- Material, size, and shape driven by compression
- Acrylic 2 x 3 x L cm Bar choosen
